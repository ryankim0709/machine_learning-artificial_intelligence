# XGBoost - 20

XGBoost is just another pre-made classification model that we can use instead of the Random Forest Classifier. This classifier is much **heavier** than the Rnadom Forest Classifier and requires **high RAM, CPU, and GPU**

How to use 
    - `import xgboost as xg` 
    - Use the `XGBClassifier()` function to initiate the model 
    - Call `fit()` with `x_train` and `y_train` to deploy the model 
    - Call `predict()` with `x_test` to predict values
