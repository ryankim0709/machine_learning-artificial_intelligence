# Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence

Hello! This is where I experiment with **machine learning and artificial intelegence!** These are some notes I created! Feel free to reference them!

## Important!
The datasets in the code will not work because they are from another source. I am sorry for the inconvenience.
